**Pocket Relay** is a custom game server emulator for **Mass Effect 3**. The server allows players to host their own servers for the game, enabling things like playing over **LAN** (Local Area Network).

This server includes a dashboard, which allows users to manage the server and even experiment with different in-game items and characters in an environment isolated from the official game servers.

The server is very performant, able to handle many simultaneous connections while using very few resources.
