        <p class="block__text">
          I am very familiar with languages such as Java and Kotlin having
          roughly 5 years experience programming with Java, 2 years with Kotlin,
          and 3 years with PHP. Since march of last year I have been making
          great strides with and am now able to comfortably use the Rust
          programming language and expect to use it quite often in future
          projects.

          I am very well accustomed to popular frontend languages like
          Javascript and Typescript with around 5 years experienced in them both
          added up. I have been using them a lot throughout many of my projects.
          I am also quite familiar with CSS and HTML having around 5 years
          experience using them both.

        <h3 class="block__title">IDE & Editors</h3>
        <p class="block__text">
          Previously I would have preferred to develop my applications using the
          JetBrains collections of IDE's however I've since grown away from
          these as my usage of the Rust language has increased and have since
          started preferring to use VSCode for most projects. However for
          writing code in Java and Kotlin I will use JetBrains IDE's still as
          they are a well designed tool for the right job. I have also been
          experimenting with modal text editors such as NeoVim and Helix in my
          off time.

        <p class="block__text">
          I am very familiar with the Laravel php framework having shipped
          multiple production projects using it in the past. NuxtJS was the
          framework which I previously developed my personal website in among
          other side projects. I have used NodeJS to make bots as well as other
          useful tools and full on server systems. This current iteration of my
          website makes use of the NextJS React framework. Recently I have come
          to use the Actix and Axum web frameworks while developing my Rust
          applications

        <p class="block__text">
          I am quite familiar with a number of front-end frameworks my favorite
          of which is VueJS. I have a few other assorted frameworks mixed in
          throughout my project but VueJS tends to be the one I rely on the
          most. However recently I've been using React more often.
