        I was born in <b>New Zealand</b> and have spent my entire life here. I've
        always had a great interest in programming. Since the age of 11 and have
        spent the majority of my time learning and building up my skills with different
        programming languages, frameworks, and toolsets. My earliest programming
        adventures came about in my days of Minecraft modding which was what inspired
        me to become a programmer by encouraging me to learn the Java programming
        language.
