Quizler v2 is my replacement for my original real-time quiz application. It comes with lots of new features and performance improvements. Quizler is a super small, easy-to-use, and deployable app for creating quizzes that can be played across multiple devices in real time. The app is intended to be small, portable, and easy to use.
