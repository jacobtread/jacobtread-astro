**Pocket Relay** is a custom server emulator that I've written for the **Mass Effect 3** game. This server acts pretends to be the official servers allowing people to play the multiplayer for **Mass Effect 3** offline, over LAN, and experiment with the different characters and weapons. This server originally was written in Kotlin but has since been rewritten in Rust. The server boasts great performance and is able to handle a number of clients while keeping memory usage < 10mb. This server branched out into the creation of many other projects in order to make it possible, many of which are listen on this page.
